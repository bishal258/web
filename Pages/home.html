								<p> It seems like it’s finally the Nepal’s time to shine
								Nepal’s name is in lights once again thanks to the travel experts at Lonely Planet, who named the country as No.1 best value destination for 2017 and No.5 on their hot list of countries to visit next year. &nbsp;</p>
								<p>
									It will be welcome news to the Nepalese people who rely on tourism to make a living, following a series of disastrous years where the country hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons: plane crashes, fatal avalanches and earthquakes.
									Nepal may have suffered a lot recently, but it is still one of the most popular places for adventure travel thanks to the diverse geography of the country – it really does offer everything.
									In the north of the country you have the Nepalese Himalayas with eight of the ten highest mountains in the world. Thousands of trails criss-cross the land, providing almost limitless opportunities for hikers and climbers to get away from it all.

									It was a real adventure and going into the Himalayas had the cachet of being a trip into the wild. On one memorable trip I walked from Kathmandu to Everest Base Camp in the winter and met almost no foreigners over the whole six week trip.
									You might come for the scenery and the wildlife, but one of the most enduring memories will be the innate friendliness of the local people. There is no doubt that Nepal has capitalised on its reputation for being warm, inviting and helpful. In all my years of organising holidays there, I have rarely come across anyone who does not mention it.
									Sherpas are one of the default images of Nepal thanks to their history with Mount Everest, but they make up only about 0.5% of the total population, which is a truly multicultural and multiethnic society with over ninety living languages and five main religions. Sherpa means Man from the East and they traditionally crossed the Himalayas from Tibet to settle in the Khumbu valleys near Everest. Their hard working, entrepreneurial spirit, coupled with an extraordinary selflessness on mountain expeditions has made them legendary around the world.
									This courage and honour is also associated with the Ghurkhas, hill tribesmen who fought the British in 1814 during the Gorkha Wars and had a reputation for their fearless military prowess.
									Such is the legend of  Nepal built around the people who live there.
									With such a rich and densely woven tapestry of culture dating back thousands of years, Nepal is known as the land of a thousand temples. There are nearly three thousand in the Kathmandu valley alone. Visitors face another limitless choice of heritage and history to explore. For example, the Maya Devi Temple in Lumbini is believed to be the spot where Buddha was born.
									But Nepal is not a mass tourism destination, it still has that exotic appeal and is a mecca for adventure activities, mountains and wildlife. As a destination it still only attracts about a million visitors a year but those people are more likely to be the intrepid and independently minded traveller.
